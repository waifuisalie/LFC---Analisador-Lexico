# Future Control Structures Test File - RA2
# Based on PDF Section 11.2.3 and 11.7.3 requirements
# Team must CREATE and DOCUMENT syntax for decision and loop structures
# Must follow RPN postfix pattern within parentheses

# Required new relational operator tokens (from PDF 11.7.3):
# > < == != >= <= (examples to be tokenized)

# Examples of expressions with relational operators (valid RPN):
(5 3 >)
(10 10 ==)
(7 8 <)
(A B !=)
(X Y >=)
(P Q <=)

# Team-designed control structure examples (syntax to be defined by team)
# These are placeholders following postfix pattern - actual syntax TBD:

# Decision structure examples (postfix pattern):
# Note: Team must design exact tokens and syntax
(5 3 > 1 0 DECISION)
(A B == (A 2 *) (B 3 +) DECISION)

# Loop structure examples (postfix pattern):
# Note: Team must design exact tokens and syntax
(1 10 I (I 2 *) LOOP)
(0 COUNT < ((COUNT 1 +) COUNT MEM) LOOP)

# Combined relational and arithmetic (already working):
((5 3 +) (4 2 *) >)
((A B *) 0 !=)
(((X 1 +) Y /) 1.5 >=)

# Regular RPN expressions (working baseline):
(5 3 +)
(10 2 /)
((1 2 +) (3 4 *) -)
(7 MEM)
(MEM 5 *)
(3 RES)

# NOTE: Control structure token names (DECISION, LOOP, etc.) are examples
# The actual token names and syntax must be designed and documented by the team
# following the PDF requirement: "postfix operators within parentheses"
